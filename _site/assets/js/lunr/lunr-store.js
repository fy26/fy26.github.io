In this project, we explored how colloidal particles interact with solute gradients and discovered that such gradients can not only move individual particles but also organize collections of them into dynamic patterns. This mechanism, diffusiophoresis, arises because short-range...","categories": [],

These liquid films can absorb extreme heat loads, reduce material erosion, and improve plasma confinement. Yet their success depends critically on whether the films remain smooth and stable under the combined action of gravity, surface...","categories": [],

In contrast, living cells achieve exquisite spatial and temporal control of fluid transport by generating forces at the molecular scale. Inspired by this principle, we developed...","categories": [],
