<meta name="description" content="This project was launched in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world urgently  needed to understand how everyday interactions contribute to airborne disease spread.  While coughing and sneezing were recognized sources of risk, the role of ordinary conversation was  far less clear. Our work revealed that normal speech produces a focused, conical jet of exhaled air  that can carry aerosolized particles over meter-scale distances in less than a minute.  This discovery showed that speech itself‚Äînot just symptomatic behaviors‚Äîcan act as a powerful transport mechanism for respiratory viruses, explaining how asymptomatic carriers might still drive transmission.">

        <p>This project was launched in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world urgently 
needed to understand how everyday interactions contribute to airborne disease spread. 
While coughing and sneezing were recognized sources of risk, the role of ordinary conversation was 
far less clear. Our work revealed that normal speech produces a focused, conical jet of exhaled air 
that can carry aerosolized particles over meter-scale distances in less than a minute. 
This discovery showed that speech itself‚Äînot just symptomatic behaviors‚Äîcan act as a powerful
transport mechanism for respiratory viruses, explaining how asymptomatic carriers might still drive transmission.</p>

<p>A key novelty of our experiments and modeling is that we quantified speech as a turbulent jet 
built from ‚Äúpuffs‚Äù associated with plosive sounds (like ‚Äúp‚Äù and ‚Äút‚Äù), linking phonetics to fluid dynamics. 
We also identified a fundamental asymmetry between exhalation and inhalation: while exhalation creates a 
directed jet that pushes aerosols forward, inhalation pulls air broadly from the surroundings, making it 
easier for a listener to inhale a speaker‚Äôs exhaled flow.</p>

<p>By combining direct flow visualization with risk modeling, we reframed social distancing as a space‚Äìtime problem. 
Risk depends not only on distance, but also on contact duration and speaking intensity. 
As shown in Fig. 1, a  1 m conversation without masks lasts only a few minutes before risk rises sharply, 
while even at 2‚Äì3 m distance, prolonged exposure can still be dangerous. 
This framework provided a mechanistic basis for guidelines that emphasize masks, ventilation, 
and limited duration of close interactions.</p>

<p>This project demonstrated that ordinary speech is sufficient to transport viruses effectively,
 giving a physical explanation for the rapid community spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. 
 By bridging linguistics, fluid dynamics, and public health, our findings influenced how scientists and 
 policymakers thought about distancing, masking, and the importance of ventilation.</p>
