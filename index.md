I am a postdoctoral scholar in Biology and Biological Engineering at Caltech, where I work with Prof. Matt Thomson. 
I earned my PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University with Prof. Howard A. Stone, where I studied 
interfacial flows and active matter. I completed my B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University. 
My academic path blends a foundation in mechanics with quantitative biology, giving me a unique vantage point to tackle problems 
at the interface of engineering and life sciences.

I aim to translate **fundamental principles of biomechanics into programmable engineering and medical applications**.
Mechanical forces are not passive outcomes of biology—they actively regulate gene expression, cell fate, and tissue morphogenesis.
My research integrates theoretical models, quantitative experiments, spatial omics, and data-driven inference to reveal how biological forces generate structure and function across scales.
I have developed the Active Matter Programming Language for dynamic microfluidic control, uncovered self-healing mechanisms in cytoskeletal networks, and am currently building a Bayesian 
inference framework to extract cell motility from images and identify motility–gene correlations driving tumor progression.
Together, my work establishes a roadmap toward programmable biomechanical principles that can inspire new bioengineering platforms, diagnostics, and therapeutic strategies.
