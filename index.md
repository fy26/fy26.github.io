I am a postdoctoral scholar in **Biology and Biological Engineering at Caltech**, working with Prof. Matt Thomson. 
My research bridges fluid mechanics and biology to uncover how forces shape molecular, cellular, and tissue-scale 
dynamics. Ultimately, I aim to develop **programmable bioengineering principles** that inspire new materials, 
diagnostics, and therapeutic strategies.
