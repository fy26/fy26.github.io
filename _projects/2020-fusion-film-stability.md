Future fusion reactors may employ flowing liquid metals, 
such as lithium, to protect plasma-facing walls.
These liquid films can absorb extreme heat loads, 
reduce material erosion, and improve plasma confinement. 
Yet their success depends critically on whether the films remain smooth 
and stable under the combined action of gravity, surface tension, 
and powerful magnetic fields inside a reactor. 
If the surface ruptures or drips, it can expose the underlying 
solid wall and contaminate the plasma with  metalâ€”undermining 
reactor performance.

In this project, we developed 
theoretical models and numerical simulations 
to analyze the Rayleighâ€“Taylor instability of 
thin conductive films in strong magnetic fields. 
Classical theory shows that a heavier fluid sitting atop 
a lighter one is unstable, but our work extended this picture 
to finite-thickness, electrically conductive films relevant for 
liquid lithium in tokamaks. 
We demonstrated that horizontal magnetic fields strongly suppress 
instability growth, especially for long-wavelength disturbances, 
and that surface tension further narrows the unstable window of modes.
Using customized magnetohydrodynamic solvers, we confirmed these 
predictions and mapped out the regimes where lithium films can 
remain intact on reactor walls.

By identifying the stability limits of liquid-metal coatings, 
this work provided essential design rules for plasma-facing components
in future reactors. It showed that carefully chosen magnetic configurations 
and film thicknesses can stabilize lithium films against disruptive 
instabilities, helping to unlock the promise of liquid-metal walls for 
sustainable fusion energy.
