We show that overlapping diffusive boundary layers of motors define a **geometric threshold** for repair: V-shaped cracks **heal** below a critical opening angle and **buckle open** above it. A minimal elastic model coupled to active stresses predicts outcomes from geometry and activity.

- **Built:** Complex-fluids simulation + minimal elastic model
- **Findings:** Bifurcation between healing and buckling
- **Impact:** Mechanistic basis for self-healing in cytoskeletal materials
