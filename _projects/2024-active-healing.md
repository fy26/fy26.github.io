Cytoskeletal networks are not only dynamic but also remarkably resilient: 
they can repair structural defects and restore function after damage. 
Yet the mechanisms of self-healing  remain largely unknown. 
In this project, we used the  light-activated microtubuleâ€“motor system to 
uncover how networks autonomously repair cracks and gaps. By projecting defined geometries of 
blue light, we generated O-shaped and V-shaped microtubule networks with controlled defects 
and observed their repair in real time.

Figure 1: Self-healing behavior of O-shaped active networks is governed by a critical gap width.

Our experiments reveal that healing is governed by overlapping boundary layers of 
motors that crosslink and rejoin microtubules across a defect. This mechanism defines a 
critical geometrical threshold: narrow gaps heal, while wider ones rupture further. 
For V-shaped cracks, we discovered a striking bifurcationâ€”networks zip closed below a critical 
angle but buckle open above it. Through continuum simulations and a minimal elastic-rod model,
we showed that geometry and active stress together dictate the healing outcome.

This work establishes active healing as a distinct design principle
in active matter: energy-consuming motors can encode mechanical logic, 
where structural fate depends on geometry and stress. By demonstrating how 
cytoskeletal networks can autonomously repair damage, this project 
provides insight into structural resilience in cells, and opens new avenues for 
engineering self-healing biomaterials 
that dynamically repair themselves.
