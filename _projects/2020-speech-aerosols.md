Flow-resolved modeling of **localized person-to-person** exposure yields distancing guidance that depends on **both** separation and interaction time; complements well-mixed models.

- **Outputs:** PRFluids Rapid Comm. (Editors’ Suggestion), PNAS (2020)
- **Use case:** Indoor risk assessment; policy-relevant mechanics
