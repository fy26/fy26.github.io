A central challenge in microfluidics is that flows 
are typically controlled by pumps and rigidly fabricated 
channels, which are difficult to reconfigure once built. 
In contrast, living cells achieve exquisite spatial and 
temporal control of fluid transport by generating forces 
at the molecular scale. Inspired by this principle, 
we developed a light-controlled 
“active matter programming language” that uses 
reconstituted motor–microtubule networks to directly 
sculpt micrometer-scale flows.

Our key innovation is a strategy to tame the intrinsic chaos of active matter. 
By patterning light at carefully chosen distances, 
we suppress unwanted nonlinear interactions and recover 
linear superposition, allowing complex flows to be 
designed predictably from simple modules. 
This is the first demonstration that active fluids,
long regarded as uncontrollable, can be composed into 
reliable, programmable flow fields.

With this platform, we show that microscale 
flows can be dynamically “written” and reconfigured 
to perform canonical tasks such as transporting and 
separating cells, probing the rheology of polymers, 
dividing lipid vesicles, and mixing at low Reynolds number.
Unlike conventional microfluidics, our system does not 
require pumps, valves, or fixed geometries; instead, 
it uses light as software to reprogram flows in real time.

This work establishes a new paradigm where biological
active matter becomes an engineering substrate, 
bridging physics, biology, and microfluidics. 
By transforming chaotic cytoskeletal activity 
into a programmable toolkit, our approach 
opens avenues for adaptive lab-on-a-chip devices,
precision manipulation of biological samples, and
ultimately, bio-inspired strategies for materials 
design and diagnostics.
