We discovered that when hydrodynamic interactions are spatially confined, flows from contractile microtubule–motor networks obey linear superposition. Treating rectangular light bars as composable primitives enabled a **programming language for active matter** that performs key microfluidic tasks without pumps or prefabricated channels.

- **Built:** Light-programmable motor–microtubule platform
- **Enables:** Cell transport/isolation, cluster separation, vesicle division, active mixing
- **My role:** Concept, theory/experiments, writing
