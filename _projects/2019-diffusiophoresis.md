Analytical and experimental studies of **charged drops** under concentration gradients; extension to interacting particles with adsorption/desorption chemistry shows nonlinear speedâ€“flux relations due to modified Debye layers.

- **Outputs:** JFM 852 (2018); JFM 865 (2019)
- **Relevance:** Synthetic active particles; transport in porous/complex media
