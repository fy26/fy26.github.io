A non-equilibrium inference framework extracts **velocity** and **stress** 
from a single segmented image (no time-lapse). Applied to tumor microenvironments with spatial omics, immune cells—especially T cells—experience **higher mechanical stress** than tumor cells, suggesting a physical barrier to immune infiltration.

- **New:** Non-equilibrium extension beyond force-balance methods
- **With:** Spatially resolved, image-based analysis
- **Next:** Coupling with GRN/vertex models (e.g., YAP/TAZ) for predictive transitions
