Experiments + 1D modeling reveal universal thinning curves during dripping of viscous films forming annuli that rupture then heal. Predicts entrapped bubbles and satellite formation; agrees with measurements.

- **Output:** PRL 124:224501 (2020)
- **Why it matters:** Canonical interfacial-flow singularity with biomedical/industrial relevance
